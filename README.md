# Web Pages To PDF
Convert your Pocket export or any URL list into organized PDFs for offline backup and archiving.

A simple Python tool to convert your Pocket export or any URL+label list into PDFs, organized by labels for easy offline backup.

Pocket is sunsetting â€” export your saved articles now and archive them as PDFs, sorted in folders by tags.  
Supports fallback to Wayback Machine if the original page is inaccessible.
